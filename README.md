# Retail_Churn_Prediction
To identify customers with a probability of churn, i.e., recall should be high, but not at the cost of introducing many false positives.
## Client Information & Objective
- Retailkart.com is a small and medium-scale organization that majorly deals in wine, fruit and meat products, having held around 35% market share. The company has been leading the domain offline for a long time.
- The critical problem for retailkart.com is to stay competitive. Competing with rapidly expanding companies offering quick and free deliveries while still accepting online purchases at affordable costs is challenging. As a result, the company is losing market share, and customer behaviour patterns are also changing.
- The companyâ€™s near-term objective is to maintain its overall market share, with the increasing competition offering 10-minute delivery, among other benefits.
- However, it has become critical for the company to retain its existing customers (prevent customer churn) and drive growth on the platform.
